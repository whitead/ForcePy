Example 1: Coarse-graining a Trajectory of Water
==========

The ForcePy module can be used to coarse-grained a trajectory. In this
example, we'll convert an all-atom water simulation to a 2-site water
model.

The first step is to import the necessary libraries:

```python
from MDAnalysis import Universe
from ForcePy import *
```

Next, we load the fine-grained trajectory. The first file
is the structure (`pdb`, `tpr`, `gro`, or `psf`) and the
second file is the trajectory. Note that the `tpr` file reader depends highly
on what version of gromacs with which the `tpr` file was created. See the 
[help page](https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/wiki/TPRReaderDevelopment) 
about the `tpr` file format support in MDAnalysis. The code to load the 
fine-grained trajectory is:

```python
fine_uni = Universe("foo.tpr", "foo.trr")
fine_uni.trajectory.periodic = True #NOTE: You MUST set this flag yourself
```

Now we create a coarse-grained trajectory using the fine-grained trajectory as 
an input:

```python
coarse_uni =CGUniverse(fine_uni, selections=['name OW', 'name HW1 or name HW2'], 
                      names=['O', 'H2'], 
                       collapse_hydrogens=False)
```

The `selections` variable is an array of strings. Each string is a
Charmm atom selection string. Note, these are very similar to VMD
selection string. You may test them out using the following snippet::

```python
selected_atoms = fine_uni.selectAtoms('name OW')
for a in selected_atoms:
    print a
```

In the example above water oxygen is the first string and water hydrogens
are the second string. The next variable, `names`, is optional and is
the array of names to be given to the selections. It is an array of
strings the same length as `selections`. If `names` is not given, then
the atoms in the resulting coarse-grained trajectory will have numbers
as their names. The last variable, `collapse_hydrogens`, can be `True`
or `False`. If it's `True`, then all hydrogens will automatically be
included in neighboring atoms which are selected. So, for example, if
you select a carbon, all its hydrogens will be included. Its default
is `False`.

Now that you have a coarse-grained trajectory, you may write out the
structure or trajectory using the following syntax:

```python
write_structure(coarse_uni, "cg_foo.pdb")
write_structure(coarse_uni, "cg_foo.pdb", bonds='all')
write_trajectory(coarse_uni, "cg_foo.dcd")
```
    

The coarse-grained trajectory is also a valid MDAnalysis object and
you may perform any analysis techniques on it from the
[MDAnalysis](https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/) package.
    
Adding Bonds
--------------------

Bonding information isn't always included in pdb files. To add a bond
manually, use this line of code:

```python
add_residue_bonds(coarse_uni, 'name O', 'name H2')    
```

This will bond all atoms named `O` with all atoms named `H2` *within
each residue*. To add bonds between residues, use this line of code:

```python
add_sequential_bonds(coarse_uni, 'name C', 'name N')    
```

The two selection strings will be the bonded parts of each residue.

Example 2: Coarse-graining a Protein
==================

Here are some examples of coarse-graining a protein with increasingly
more coarse models

3-Beads per Residue
-----------

```python
from MDAnalysis import Universe
from ForcePy import *

protein_file = 'foo.pdb'
fine_uni = Universe(protein_file)

cgu_1 = CGUniverse(fine_uni, ['name O or C', 'name N or name CA', '((not name C) and (not name O)) and ((not name n) and (not name CA))'], ['O', 'CA', 'S'], collapse_hydrogens=True)

add_residue_bonds(cgu_1, 'name O', 'name CA')
add_residue_bonds(cgu_1, 'name CA', 'name S')
add_sequential_bonds(cgu_1, 'name CA', 'name CA')
write_structure(cgu_1, 'cg_1.pdb', bonds='all')
```

The first bead is the carbonyl group, the second is the C-alpha and
nitrogen, and the final is the side-chain.

1-Bead per Residue
---------

```python
cgu_2 = CGUniverse(fine_uni, ['all'])
add_sequential_bonds(cgu_2)
write_structure(cgu_2, 'cgu_2.pdb', bonds='all')
```

This is much simpler. The names are omitted for the beads and it is
not necessary to pass selection strings to `add_sequential_bonds()`
since there is only one atom in each residue.

3-Residues per Bead
--------------

Finally, here is how to put multiple residues into single beads. An
array must be passed to the CGUniverse constructor which has a length
of the desired number of beads and the array contains arrays of
indices corresponding to the fine-grain residue indices. For example,
to put residues `1,2,3` into a bead and residues `4,5` into another
bead this array will accomplish that: `[[1,2,3], [4,5]]`. Here is a
complete example of reducing every three residues into one bead:

```python
protein_length = len(fine_uni.residues)
reduction_map = [[3 * x, 3 * x + 1, 3 * x + 2] for x in range(protein_length / 3)]
cgu_3 = CGUniverse(fine_uni, ['all'],
                   residue_reduction_map=reduction_map)
add_sequential_bonds(cgu_3)
write_structure(cgu_3, 'cgu_3.pdb', bonds='all')
```


Force-Matching
===================
Let's use again the example of 2-site water. If the original all-atom
trajectory had forces, then we may use this file for force-matching.

```python
from MDAnalysis import Universe
from ForcePy import *
import pickle
    
fgu = Universe('topol.tpr', 'traj.trr')
fgu.trajectory.periodic = True #NOTE: You MUST set this flag yourself, since there is no indication in the TPR files
cgu = CGUniverse(fgu, ['name OW', 'name HW1 or name HW2'], ['O', 'H2'], False)
add_residue_bonds(cgu, 'name O', 'name H2')
fm = ForceMatch(cgu) 
```    

At this point, we have a `ForeMatch` object which contains the
coarse-grained universe. Now we need to set-up the force field which
will be force-matched to fit the coarse-grained trajectory forces
(which themselves came from the all-atom trajectory).

```python 
ff = FileForce() #This just says the forces are found in the universe passed to the ForceMatch object
#Set this force as the reference force to be matched
fm.add_ref_force(ff)    

pair_mesh = Mesh.UniformMesh(0,12,0.05) #This is the mesh on which the force-field will be built. It is in Angstroms
pairwise_force = SpectralForce(Pairwise, pair_mesh, Basis.UnitStep)  
#Copy this force type and clone it for each pair-interaction type
fm.add_and_type_pair(pairwise_force)
#This is a harmonic bond that will be fixed to the energy minimum of the bonds with a harmonic constant of 500 kJ/mol
bond_force = FixedHarmonicForce(Bond, 500, cutoff=1) 
fm.add_and_type_pair(bond_force)
```
    
At this point, can now force match. To do it in serial:

```python    
fm.force_match()
```
    
You may also pass an `iterations` argument to use less than the entire
trajectory. To do it in parallel (note you must have started using
mpirun, mpiexec, or aprun depending on your MPI environment)

```python    
fm.force_match_mpi()
```

One thing about MPI runs is that it's much faster to pre-compute all
the trajectory mapping at the beginning so that it isn't repeated on
each node. This may be done by changing a line:

```python    
cgu = CGUniverse(fgu, ['name OW', 'name HW1 or name HW2'], ['O', 'H2'], False)
#this will precompute the cg trajectory at every frame; this may take some time
cgu = cgu.cache()
```

Finally, to write out the a set of lammps scripts to use the new force field, run

```python    
fm.write_lammps_scripts()
```
  

Installing ForcePy
===============

Dependencies
----------

* Python2.7
* scipy/numpy
* MDAnalysis (development branch)

Optional Dependencies
----------

* MPI4Py (for parallel force-matching)
* matplotlib (for plotting)

Install
----------

First install the development branch of MDAnalysis

```sh
git clone https://code.google.com/p/mdanalysis/ mdanalysis
cd mdanalysis
git checkout develop
cd package
python setup.py install --user
```
    
Next install ForcePy

```sh     
cd ../../
git clone https://github.com/whitead/ForcePy.git ForcePy
cd ForcePy
python setup.py install --user
```

If you see a long list of errors, check the first few. If it says it
can't find `arrayobject.h`, then your numpy headers are not being
found. If you're in the Voth group and using the Enthought python
distribution, try adding this line to your `~/.profile` or
`~/.bash_profile` file:

```bash
export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/local/include:/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.2/lib/python2.7/site-packages/numpy/core/include:$C_INCLUDE_PATH
```

  
Architecture Notes
==================

The main class to utilize is a `ForceMatch` class. This class takes in
one or more reference `Force` objects that define the forces to
match. For example, a `FileForce` will read in forces from a file. The
`ForceMatch` class also takes one or more target `Force` objects,
which are the functional forms that are going to match the reference
forces. Some `Force` objects contain a static class variable that
points to a `ForceCategory` that contains useful
methods/variables. For example, the `Pairwise` contains a
neighborlist implementation.

Regularizers may be added to force objects as well by calling the
`add_regularizer` method.

The `SpectralForce` is a linear combination of basis functions. This
is usually a good choice. The `SpectralForce` requires a mesh and
basis function. Currently only `UniformMesh` is implemented. For the
basis functions, `UnitStep`, `Quartic`, and `Gaussian` are
implemented.

A given `Force` may be 'specialized' to work on only a certain type or
type pair. This may be done by calling `specialize_type` before it is
added to a `ForceMatch` class.

In order to simplify constructing potentials for many type pairs,
there are utility functions on the ForceMatch class to construct all
possible pairs. `add_and_type_pairs` copies a force as many times as
needed to have a unique force for every possible pair-pair
interaction.
